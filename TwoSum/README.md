Two-Sum
=======

The file contains 1 million integers, both positive and negative (there might
be some repetitions!).This is your array of integers, with the ith row of the
file specifying the ith entry of the array.

Your task is to compute the number of target values t in the interval
\[-10000,10000\] (inclusive) such that there are distinct numbers x,y in the
input file that satisfy x+y=t. (NOTE: ensuring distinctness requires a one-line
addition to the algorithm from lecture.)

Write your numeric answer (an integer between 0 and 20001) in the space
provided.
