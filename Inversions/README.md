Counting Inversions
===================

Given an arbitrarily ordered array with elements _1,2,3,..,n_,
count the number of out of order pairs. That is pairs, _(i,j)_ where 
**i < j** and **A[i] > A[j]**.

Solution - 1
------------
Use Divide and Conquer paradigm, modified version of MergeSort.

Solution - 2
------------
Use efficient data structure. Slick implementation of counting inversions.

Note
----
Since this is also programming assignment 1 (PA1), 
I will commit the solutions when the course ends.
